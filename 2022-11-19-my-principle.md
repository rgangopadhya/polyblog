Topics I'm thinking about these days:
* Computational geometry. Delaunay triangulation and alpashapes. Thinking about thinking
* Capitalism
* Systems thinking

More immediately, OSM and the ecosystem of OSM tools like Osmium. I continue to be inspired by the incredible
open source contributions that my company relies on. It's well documented how software companies generate
wealth through extraction of largely unpaid labor (the open source community). It makes me realize how
little I know about open source.

I wonder how far we'll go in the next 50 years. It is crazy to think that Linux is about 30 years old now. What
a game changer.

Inventing on principle... what is my principle?

I believe that it is impossible to be completely certain about anything outside of math. Uncertainty is a basic fact of life.
The beauty of Godel's incompleteness theorem is that even something as certain as math has limits: the limits of language to
be able to express only a subset of reality. You can change the language to capture different subsets of reality.

This inherent uncertainty demands humility.

I believe that the real problems to be solved for humanity are social, political, and cultural. Not technological. Of course,
technology is an expression of culture. Technology (creating or extending new tools) changes the context in which the core
human problems can be addressed, but the real issue is social, spiritual. Capitalism and colonialism disconnect us from our
humanity, creating new problems which we then solve through technology. This edges towards the 'noble savage' trope, which
is far too simplistic; I'm not saying that we shouldn't have or continue to develop technology. Only that, in my opinion,
our technological development has for some time vastly exceeded our social development, to the point where we are about to
destroy humanity because of it.

This is not exactly an 'invention' principle because it is in a sense avoidant of the notion of invention.

So, it begs the question... what is my principle of invention?

I build tools for domain experts. I have built them for healthcare, education, and transportation. I believe that
software is an inherently limited medium, one that
