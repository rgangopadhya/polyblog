# Bill Gates and the Measurement Obsession

​	Bill Gates has gained a reputatation among liberals and progressives as the 'rational philanthropist,' someone who uses data to make the best decisions, and advocates the practice of data-driven decision making in the organizations he supports. "Data-driven" decision making involves using some quantifiable measure to optimize the operation of an organization. This, naturally, is best done on a computer. His philanthropy is viewed as gracious, for the benefit of the future of humanity. As influential as his work is, it cannot be ignored that his data-driven philosophy stands to benefit Microsoft, and the software industry writ large, which he continues to have a stake in. This is done at the expense of the public good, while profiting off of it.

​	In his mind, there is no conflict of interest here: the problems in healthcare, international development, and education all stem from a lack of using data. Software, then, and technology more broadly, is seen as the primary driver of positive change. This philosophy ignores critical factors that are and will always be unmeasured: the historical, cultural, psychological, political, social. His investments routinely minimize the importance of these factors in perpetuating poverty, instead placing technology as the means to overcome what is presumed otherwise unsurmountable. This approach recasts these endeavors as businesses focused on turning a profit, on providing their investors with a return on investment. It assumes that meaningful change can be made _without_ addressing historical factors, ensuring that the status quo is maintained. It shifts the conversation from the problem to a particular solution, without the problem being fully understood or articulated. I have worked at two companies directly or indirectly supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). I have seen this firsthand.

## BloomBoard

​	BloomBoard is a Silicon Valley education technology startup focused on educator professional development (PD). When I interviewed with the CEO of the time, Jason Lange, he bragged about the "crazy" things they were going to do with the data they had. BloomBoard was where administrators input their teacher evaluation data after conducting classroom observations, including things like an annotated copy of the lesson plan, and scores on each of the educator effectiveness indicators. To support remote coaching, BloomBoard also allowed educators to upload videos of their practice. BloomBoard hoped to use this data to recommend the appropriate piece of content from their PD library, which consisted primarily of videos. More broadly, BloomBoard aimed to insert itself into many aspects of an educator's PD experience, from coaching, workshops, conferences, and recertification to curriculum selection and planning. BloomBoard wanted to use this data to identify good teachers, record their practice, and share it with others.

​	In truth, the data was insufficient to make the recommendations we wanted to make, and the PD library, our main focus, was a pale imitation of having a coach or going to a workshop. But that didn't matter. BloomBoard quickly reached 200,000 teachers by signing state or district level contracts with Newark Public Schools, Green Dot Charter Schools, KIPP, the Colorado Department of Education, the Connecticut DOE, and many others. As I learned during user interviews, the most important thing administrators were expecting from BloomBoard was that it would make their teacher evaluation process a little easier. Something everyone wanted to do, but had no time for, was actually improving teaching. Schools were incentivized to adopt digital teacher evaluation solutions as part of Every Student Succeeds (ESSA), so administrators were both eager to get the extra federal funding, and to find something, anything, that would lessen the pressure of accountability.

​	But when the rubber met the road, when it came time to prepare the final evaluation reporting to the state, BloomBoard's product was unable to deliver. Administrators and teachers alike complained that the interface took more time away from them than it saved. Engineers rushed in hacks specific to each state's needs. Account managers worked 70-80 hour weeks doing the work the technology wasn't doing. BloomBoard had succeeded in selling its product on promises of the revolutionary things that could be done with data, in the _future_, but that narrative had little to back it _now_. The CEO and sales team had succeeded in grabbing as much of the market as they could, as quickly as they could, by promising more than was possible.

​	Likewise, the employees were promised that eventually, things would calm down. Once we weathered the storm, we would have time to take a step back and understand what wasn't working, and fix it. We would have more time to think about how to improve practice, and spend less time on just playing catch-up, the debt that our land-grab strategy had accrued. We were promised time to review and conduct research, to develop a clearer understanding of how we could help improve teaching practice. But as soon as one fire cleared away, another was stoked by the board and CEO, in the constant drive to secure more funding from VCs.

​	It was clear to me that the teacher evaluation system we were supporting was not improving teaching, nor, for that matter, learning. We were supporting the needs of accountability, of administration, which had become so focused on making sure districts proved their worth that it became all schools focused on, particular in low-income districts. If we were supposed to be the revolution, why did it feel like we were double agents? As a VC-funded company, our real focus was on securing the next round of funding. We knew what sold VCs. It was the same thing that sold investors on Google and Facebook. The life-changing power of data. No one wanted to understand where the data came from, in what context it was gathered, what assumptions were made in reducing extremely complex events into a few fields in a database. Everyone was looking for the same story to play out in new domains. So why should education be any different? This belief was almost religious, and it blinded BloomBoard and its investors to the limits of this approach.

​	To be fair, no company, no individual actor, could realize a grand vision for education. I do not protest that BloomBoard was, by itself, unable to further a progressive vision when many forces maintain the status quo. No company can see beyond the immediate market. Even companies that 'create' markets are merely reading the market differently than others. This is precisely why you can't expect companies to produce social change: it would be highly unprofitable, at least in the time scales that they are able to consider. BloomBoard's leadership, though, did not think of itself as merely filling a void created by accountability. It was unclear whether this was 'selling in,' protecting the sanctity of the marketing narrative by ensuring its respect within the company itself, or whether they truly believed in the purity of the BloomBoard vision. I take issue with this hubris, and with using it both to recruit new hires and to sell the product. It distracts, rather than clarifies, the reality before us: our problem with education is not technical. Businesses cannot create social change because they are inherently myopic.

### Notes

I need to untangle narrative from reality. BloomBoard's narrative was absolute: we will change the world with our approach. An almost religious belief that technology by itself would make things better. Where does this manifest itself, and where does it fall down? What does it ignore? Concrete examples. Reality was that the narrative was simply a marketing tool. If we ignore the narrative, and view instead the way in which BloomBoard played a role in the ed-tech ecosystem: it was an experiment in PD market. Hypothesis (changed many times): 

It can't just be that I disagree a) with the problem statement, and b) with the solution. Something more fundamental than that. 

BloomBoard's stated purpose was to help make great teachers. This requires having a notion of what a great teacher is, a method for observing this in practice, and some process for professional development. The United States has, at the policy level, avoided delving too deeply into the question of what a 'great teacher' is.  

BloomBoard dangled the promise of doing 'research' on the data for years. But, it never was able to prioritize that. It was always more important to expand our hold over the market as quickly as possible, even beyond our ability to meet it, and then spend all of our energy maintaining that hold by making good on impossible promises. This indicated that the CEO and the board alike felt it was more important to establish market dominance than it was to solve a clear problem. The thinking was, take as much of the market as possible, based on narrative and a promise of _future_ value, and understand the market needs as you go. That way, if things don't work out, an acquisition could be based just on your market foothold. Before the technology can meet the needs you promised it would, use cheap labor (in the form of Account Managers, who worked 60-70 hours and were underpaid) to brute force meet the needs and maintain your hold on the market. This is classic startup logic.

What is the problem with this? The problem is a) these market experiments experiment over business model, but not over substantially improving the lot of the users in the system (this is true because people are buying the software based on a _promise_ of future value, not on existing value. Administrators and teachers were extremely frustrated with the product BloomBoard offered, complaining that it took more time than it saved.), b) the focus on market foothold meant there was never time to consider in any detail what the real need we would meet was. We simply had faith that schools needed more technology. 

* BloomBoard focused on market dominance over a clear problem statement, revealing their focus on profit first..

  * Need to show this more clearly. "Improve teaching with technology" is unclear. "Use evaluation data to drive PD content recommendations" is more clear, but we were very uncommitted to that. What were the plethora of ideas that existed?
    * micro-credentials
    * pinterest concept
    * digital coaching

* Schools bought into this because they were incentivized to do so by ESSA, and because the narrative of tech solving problems was powerful for them as well

* BloomBoard used this narrative to sell, but ultimately could not make it a reality. This was impossible because the problems it was trying to solve were far beyond software, but it could only consider the software aspect. It did turn more and more towards services as time went on. 

* Seeking a 'formula' to turn a mediocre teacher into a great one. Some way to take scores in, put out recommendations, and show results. 

  The concept of the company was apparently based on research: that the biggest factor in a student's success was the quality of the teacher. So, BloomBoard thought, if we can just find the recipe for what makes a great teacher, we can make a positive impact. There was no discussion of what _defines_ a 'great teacher': the definition was given to us. A 'great teacher' is one who, more than anything, shows growth in their students test scores.

What am I advocating for as an alternative? What did BloomBoard's model fail to consider? In what way is its solution/approach ignorant of social, cultural, and historical realities?

* BloomBoard's content was devoid of anything inspirational
  * Draws little from pedagogy or cognitive science, much more focused on 5-minute tips for immediate problems in the classroom, little things you can change in your practice. Certainly laudable to improve on these in practice, but one has to wonder if this is the right medium for these conversations — is this happening in lieu of a real community of educators in schools? 
  * For an educator that is really struggling, it is hard to imagine that reading an article about "Using Humor in the Classroom" will really turn their practice around.
  * "Reducing Teacher Liability in Urban High School Settings", "Establishing a Culture for Learning", "Maintain a Quiet Classroom Without Having to Say a Word", "Incorporating Technology in the Classroom for Guided Learning and Student Centered Classrooms"
  * No material intended to reconnect teachers in a deep way with their subject, reigniting the curiosity within such that they might do the same with their students
  * Certainly some worthwhile discussions taking place (e.g., "Killing Me Softly With Homework")… I'm not saying that BloomBoard has NO value. The question is: where, directionally, is BloomBoard taking us? Is the investment made in this and other platforms justified in lieu of investing in better teacher training, in creating supportive environments in schools? 
    * Amount invested in BloomBoard is not huge… ~$12 million. So why not take the risk? I agree, provided that the end result is for the greater good. But I don't agree with the end result of BloomBoard… why? Because it is founded on accountability, and won't support teachers in improving their practice in reality. 
* We must "identify the desired end result, and THEN the means we have to reach that, and use our means to go in the direction of the desired end result." We should not start with our means. 
* The real situation:
  * Systematic racism and oppression, police brutality, exclusion from housing. Segregation. Intentional limitation of funding. These are the root causes. We must address these first! Safety of the black body, as Coates speaks of.

  Joanne Weiss, former chief of staff for Arne Duncan, spoke to us one lunch. Recognizing the turmoil and the incontinence of the changes she had helped put in place, she reassured us that chaos was the forebearer of a better system. When she spoke, she betrayed no understanding of education history, of pedagogy. Instead, she spoke as the manager of a large business.  

## AltSchool

​	AltSchool promised to be a different kind of education technology company. Originally aiming to leverage its growing pool of 'micro-schools' towards building the 'killer app' for the progressive pedagogy of Montessori and Reggio which it would later sell to public schools, it sold me on the promise of being in direct contact with the educators and students. Having just raised its $100 million series B, with no impending demands for acquisition or even profitability, AltSchool could take its time, develop foundational understanding of the role technology could play in the classroom, and build on that. At least, that was the narrative. The truth was not dissimilar to what I had seen at BloomBoard. The belief in the primacy of technology as a solution made AltSchool blind to the problem it was trying to solve.

​	The selling point of AltSchool was that it had both educators and engineers on staff. In theory, this meant that technology could be used to address the real challenges that educators and students faced in the classroom, rather than the artificial challenges brought on by accountability. I imagined tools akin to Logo from Papert's _Mindstorms_, or documentation focused tools enabling students to reflect on their learning in a Reggio style. Instead, the product vision was quite fixed on a single, distant point: the "AltSchool Learning Cycle," where educators assign work to students, students complete the assignment, and educators assess the work, leveraging the system's representation of a knowledge map to assist the educator in the next assignment. The more the system could assist in planning, the more valuable it could be. The origin of this focus did not come from the educators*. It came from the executive team, and the leaders of the product team. It emerged out of a combination of fear of the lack of coherence in the product without this focus, adherence to pre-existing solutions that seemed effective, and an eye towards marketability.

​	This vision, along with gradually increasing pressure from the Board and the VCs funding AltSchool, meant that the product team was held to a strict schedule for releasing updates to the product: progress towards this vision, if successful, would mean a huge ROI. But it also meant that we routinely ignored feedback from educators, because we were too busy marching to the beat of the funding drum. Every year, user experience researchers would come back from a round of interviews to give us a foundational understanding of what educators needed, and every year we ignored this in pursuit of the vision. If an educator gave feedback that didn't fit into the preset schema, we had to ignore it. We had meeting upon meeting to figure out how to increase collaboration between engineer and educator, but we never acknowledged our own assumptions were getting the way.

​	Many acknowledged that the direction of the product was flawed. As the former CEO of Amplify, regarding a similar vision as AltSchool's, put it: "[the] map doesn't exist, the measurement is impossible, and we have, collectively, built only 5% of the library." When the purpose of education is considered, learning based on and emerging from the lived experiences of the students, from exploring their own truth as a path to the insights of others in pursuit of the same, will always be superior to learning in strict sequence. One respects the agency of the learner, while the other seeks to control the outcome for the interests of another. Even if the vision were possible, it would not produce the best outcome for a democratic society. AltSchool employees believed that both were achievable at the same time, that technology could enable educators to better consider their student's lives in their planning, _while also following a strict sequence_.

​	AltSchool had huge opportunity, but little to show for it. It was a battleground between both progressive pedagogy and… whatever ed-tech's pedagogy was. Its blind belief that technology could be the mediator between the two, that there was no contradiction, revealed it had in mind a solution before it understood the problem. AltSchool's educators had great expertise in progressive pedagogy. But their expertise did not enter into AltSchool's vision.

#### Footnotes

* This is not to say that an effective assignment and planning tool is not valuable to educators. There are ways to enable educator planning in a progressive context. But the shape of the product was inherently traditional. This, to me, revealed the company's true intent: rather than 'change the shape of education', it was 'capitalize on a market'. The question is: does this capitalization still benefit educators? The truth was it didn't. The value educators derived from the product was always less than they put in. 
* I don't know what to call ed-tech's philosophy of learning… 

### Notes

My claim: focus on technology to a poorly-understood problem was in the interest of profit at the expense of the greater good. Social, cultural, historical, political contexts were actively ignored to do this.

Audrey Watters describes this vision as most strongly associated with the behaviorist B.F. Skinner

Concrete instances of this at AltSchool:

* Progression: a solution before the problem. AltSchool knew that a product like Progression is what VCs had in mind as the shape of the solution: give educators the data on each student so they know what to teach next. While not an unreasonable idea, the nature of the data was so limited that it failed to reveal more than the teachers themselves already knew from being present in the classroom everyday.
  * How was it limited? Progression assumed that to understand where a student is at in terms of, say, graphing linear equations, one only needs to measure, on a basic scale (AltSchool used 1-5, and later 1-4), on several different occasions. The product did not account for context: was the cause of their performance due to a social-emotional issue (e.g., their difficulty in learning how to graph came from their issues with concentrating)? Nor did it emphasize the activity in which the observation took place. 
  * In favor of showing what investors wanted first over empowering educators with their own data, the measurements were combined in a way that was unclear to educators and made no sense to them. The end result was the product was not trusted by the educators, at all. There were fundamental issues with the product, but the company was intent on pushing forward with it. The next year, we made another attempt to present the data back to educators in a more friendly format, but this attempt failed for a lack of clarity in the meaning of the data, and because we did not have a clear use case in mind.
  * Clarity is emerging, but the pressure to expand their customer base is directing AltSchool to market the product it has now, which is no more than an LMS (in spite of the product team's repeated claims that the product is "so much more" than an LMS). And, we are still failing to listen to teachers who view growth over time as the most important thing. Our data and the presentation of it fails to capture this.
* Co-development. Recognizing that the product was not well-liked by our own educators, that, while we were providing some value to them, it was not equal to the time they put in, nor to the massive investment placed in the company when considering existing alternatives, leadership said our focus would be to put engineers and educators side by side, so that better solutions could be developed. However, we were put on a schedule, which rendered any emergent learnings from educators pointless: we knew we had to deliver a Student Capture product by end of 2017, so anything we learned we had to throw away anyways. So, what was the point of co-development?
  * The stated benefit of the company running schools was that educators could be in direct contact with the product development team, but there were many factors detracting from that contact
    * Forced schedule of delivery, even from the very beginning. This revealed that the company felt it more important to 'show results' rather than build solid foundations. 
    * Strongly held preconceived notions of what the product would be, with a strong influence from pre-existing solutions, suggesting an interest in the market. The 'ed-tech value proposition hypothesis': represent assignments, store assessments, and use a 'map' of learning to assist the educator in deciding what to assign next. As the former CEO of Amplify testified, this approach has flaws: the map doesn't exist, assessing is limited. So the fidelity that such a product can have is very limited compared to a competent educator. 
      * Some say: we are trying to increase the floor, not raise the ceiling. I think we are lowering the floor.
      * So: why not explore other approaches to supporting educators through technology? I do believe there are valuable contributions computing can make, though as Papert noted, it must be done so that the 'child is programming the computer, not the other way around'. AltSchool's product has the uncanny feel of the computer programming the child. We explored some approaches, like a focus on documentation. But this was always de-prioritized compared to supporting the more critical parts of the 'Ed-Tech Value Proposition Hypothesis'
    * Operational/logistical issues
    * Culture. Not developed in a way conducive for connecting the two communities
* Hundreds of millions of dollars, and yet we still felt rushed, we still felt that we would have to defer identifying a clear problem statement for us to solve for, to applying research, in favor of delivery. AltSchool's employees were constantly under pressure to deliver at a certain time. We had a regular cadence of delivering changes to the software, based more on logistical concerns than anything. This dominated our approach. 

## What Is 'The Problem,' Exactly?



## Parallels in Global Health

​	The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been applauded for their involvement in global health and international development. On closer analysis, the same pattern is repeated: focusing on solutions rather than problems, utilizing technology to address complex non-technical issues, in the interest of profit. Global Justice Now, a UK-based NGO focused on global justice and development, wrote a [report](http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/resources/gjn_gates_report_june_2016_web_final_version_2.pdf) that details how the BMGF involves businesses in addressing poverty and inequality at the expense of those it is purportedly serving. In health, the BMGF has focused on curing malaria and HIV/AIDS through vaccination, which is not a neutral focus:

> It prioritised funding for malaria and HIV/AIDS, while almost entirely neglecting funds for chronic non-communicable diseases. The Lancet articles noted that while the BMGF had given a big boost to global health funding, “grants made by the foundation do not reflect the burden of disease endured by those in deepest poverty”. Funding for research on pneumonia, diarrhea and maternal and child undernutrition – which account for 75 per cent of child deaths – were relatively underfunded by the BMGF. For these diseases, the key is not the new vaccines heavily promoted by the foundation but effective preventive measures which are already well-known, such as breastfeeding and treatments, including antibiotics for pneumonia and oral rehydration therapy and zinc for diarrhea.

The report describes the reason for focusing on vaccines: pharmaceutical companies want to cheaply test their medicines on a vulnerable population. This focus on vaccines and technology takes away from other efforts to address the social, economic, and political basis of health problems. Such an approach might prioritize access to clean water and sanitation, instead.

​	On international development, particularly agriculture, Global Justice Now reports that

> [a] recent analysis of BMGF grants by the NGO, GRAIN could find no evidence of any support from the foundation for programmes of research or technology development carried out by farmers or based on farmers’ knowledge, despite the multitude of such initiatives that exist in Africa. GRAIN’s conclusion was that “nowhere in the programmes funded by the Gates Foundation is there any indication that it believes that Africa’s small farmers have anything to teach”. Rather, the foundation is “orientated towards bringing foreign technology into Africa and opening up markets to foreign corporations, rather than building on the possibilities, capacities and knowledge the farmers already have”

​	The same pattern is at play in American education. The expertise and knowledge of educators is being ignored in favor of a gold rush of technology, ostensibly in search for "what works," but in practice in support of privatization of education. If the goal of this were really to "improve education," a very different approach would be taken. Rather than mindlessly funding hundreds of companies that churn out some variant of a learning management system, wrapped in empty promises, and painstakingly crafting a vision of the promises of technology (through EdSurge, and many implementation-focused non-profits), BMGF would 

​	In Bill Gates' mind, there is nothing wrong with this. A metric, number of deaths from malaria, was picked. Interventions aimed at reducing this metric were developed, primarily vaccination. But this fails to consider the causes.

## Can Data Save Us?

## A 'Measured' Approach

​	This is not an argument _against_ using data. Instead, it is an argument _for_ considering _all_ factors that affect the system in question, and for clearly defining the problem. "Data-driven" advocates favor defining the problem in measurable terms, claiming that the unmeasurable either doesn't matter or will be accounted for in the measure. The approach to education policy has created a simplistic formulation of the problem ("Increase test scores for everyone, decrease achievement gap"), favoring the measurable.

This 

The behavior of the companies he supports has been 

This philosophy is at its heart neo-liberal. BloomBoard and AltSchool may not be the right bets, but the market needs options to find the right fit. For all their narratives of helping to 'fix' education, these businesses rely on education as it exists today to profit. This is not to say that those who invest in and run these businesses don't want education to change; they do. But that vision necessarily includes them, and they will do anything in their power to make the future of education in their image. This is why it is so important to understand what a product such as AltSchool's represents today: it will be what they advocate for tomorrow.

### What do I advocate for? 

What are these visions missing, specifically? I believe in the progressive pedagogy of Dewey and Papert. My understanding of progressive pedagogy: 

* Its perspective on epistemology is frames the learner as a scientist of the world. Learners learn by updating their pre-existing notions of the world, which are developed at quite an early age (number sense, biology, physics, language). Addressing misconceptions in terms of these pre-existing notions is critically important. Learning is not transfer of knowledge. It is experience followed by reflection upon that experience.
  * The psychology of motivation is critical here as well: addressing the learner from their perspective. We see this violated repeatedly in ed-reform and ed-tech movements, especially in lower income schools.
* The purpose of education, from Dewey: "Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself." Dewey argued powerfully that education must be done by meeting the learner where they are, by engaging them in the conditions of their environment and using that as the means to train their mind to "cultivate deep-seated and effective habits of discriminating tested  beliefs from mere assertions, guesses, and opinions; to develop a  lively, sincere, and open-minded preference for conclusions that are  properly grounded, and to ingrain into the individual’s working habits  methods of inquiry and reasoning appropriate to the various problems  that present themselves." In this way, democracy can be nurtured.

The narratives of ed-tech are bunk:

* 

The products are bunk

* Conception of learning as a sequence of steps is in total contradiction to cognitive science, and to morality
  * These sequence of steps neglect learner context, and present knowledge and the process of obtaining it as definite, when in truth knowledge itself is constantly changing, constantly shifting. There is no absolute truth to be learned, only perspectives and their place in a constant quest for the unanswerable. I do not mean that particular modes of thinking, of understanding the world, are not important to learn. But the way in which they must be learned is experiential. These tools encourage a static, universal representation of knowledge, which is impoverished compared to that of an expert.

While ed-tech businesses and investors vocally support these notions, their actions reveal otherwise, in the products they develop, the business models they pursue. 

I believe that a democracy has a moral, existential, and economic imperative to have education be public. By public, I mean not only that funding for schools comes from government coffers, but that schools are operated by, for, and of the people in the community it serves. I mean that its primary purpose is not to prepare people for work, but to be a part of the living of it. I believe that an education that is demanding of its participants, that expands their being and their character, is not expensive. It needs just a few things: an educator who is well-trained and supported, as part of a larger community of 'expert learners.' A space which is comfortable. Materials wise, educators are moving away from textbooks, but certainly access to a library (digital or otherwise) of content is important.

Concrete recommendations:

* Reduce accountability. High-stakes testing has gained us very little for great cost. It has poisoned the culture of schools and destroyed communities
* Instead, place emphasis on educator training and professional development. A safe community around the educators will lead to a safe community for the students.
*
