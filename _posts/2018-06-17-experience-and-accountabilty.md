​	Learning based on experience. I'm looking at the growth of tuberose flowers. We have two sectors of bulbs, one of which flowered first. The observation of flowering over a long period of time has given me a deeper understanding of plant biology. Growing my own garden has taught me how to diagnose plant health and build a basic internal model of how a plant grows.

​	This type of understanding is entirely different from reading an account of the same, or consuming some other media. Regardless of the medium, the understanding derived is necessarily diluted from experiencing it yourself. It is on these grounds that I oppose accountability based on standardized tests, which still remains a cornerstone of American education policy. This structure incentivizes 'teaching to the test' and other practices which make for poor pedagogy due to their diluted transmittal of experience. This is particularly true in public schools in underserved communities, which are fighting for survival.

​	Charters were the ostensible replacement and solution, "laboratories" for learning "what works" in education. But for whom, and to what end? Charters have failed to deliver on their promise, having indistinguishable test results compared to peer public schools and, even for those above the curve, lack of reproducibility.

​	AltSchool and its ilk are in theory a response to the crisis created by accountability. To progress in a system incentivizing diluted experiential transmittal, in which each component in the system is directed towards test scores, an emphasis on compliance through documentation emerges. This becomes the priority of the educator, the principal, the district superintendent, the state board, the federal Department of Education. This has posed quite a challenge for educators and students in particular.

​	This is the real 'pain point' AltSchool and other education technologies aim to solve. AltSchool believes it can build a product that can allow the system and participants to 'have its cake and eat it too' in terms of meeting _both_ the goals of accountability and progressive pedagogy. AltSchool's educators and school administrators strongly subscribe to Montessori and Reggio philosophies of learning and teaching, while the PR and marketing department are all too happy to leverage this in building AltSchool's brand. This attitude fails to recognize that the goals of student agency advocated for by progressive pedagogy are in direct conflict with the goals of accountability.

​	The two cannot be met at the same time. Standardized testing based accountability encourages (and, at the limit of fewer resources, requires) dilution of experience, while progressivism encourages richer and more direct experience. With fewer resources and more obstacles affecting test performance, underserved schools must naturally focus on the 'most efficient' means to achieve results: test prep. Ed-tech, at its 'best', aims to make this process more palatable, while at the same time giving students real agency. This is not possible.

​	Of course, dilution of experience is a natural way of increasing the breadth of understanding. Diluted experience represents the distillate of others experience, and thus can be transferred to others much more quickly. There is certainly an argument based on efficiency to be made in favor of using media (indirect transmittal of experience). This is not an argument against reading books or engaging in other media as a means of learning from experience. It is an argument against practices which encourage diluted forms of experience _in favor of_ richer forms for the purposes of measurement and accountability, and against education technology encoding these practices, implicitly or explicitly.
