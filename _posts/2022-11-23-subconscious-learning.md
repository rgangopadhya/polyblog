Learning as a subconcious process. What does it really mean to know something? There is a difference between intellectual understanding and embodied understanding. Music, math, programming, relationships, cooking. Embodied understanding allows for synthesis (blooms taxonomy). 

It constantly surprises me how learning is a subconscious process. By that I mean that to really understand something, to know it, it is not enough to have an intellectual understanding. You must also have an embodied understanding. And this can only be developed over time, through practice. It is this practice that differentiates skill level, more so than any particular talent. So what? Why should I (you, they) care that this is the case? Our culture does not actually understand this. You can see it in the way that we teach math in the United States. We favor progress in terms of mechanical demonstration of techniques on simple problems, problems that are easily evaluated. Success here looks superficially like the result of the kind of "practice" I was talking about, but it's not. You end up with students who can't apply addition to real-world problems. The Russian system's focus on word problems at a very early age increased the average math competency significantly.

This lack of understanding also shows in how software engineers try to teach other things. Explanation can only go so far. Assuming you have already internalized the necessary abstractions, it's easy to build on top of them with a quick explanation. But internalizing those abstractions takes time.

In math, we call it "building intuition." Mathematicians communicate using formalisms, but that does not relate to the process that they go through to reach their insights: the formalism is to communicate externally, but not to reach the same conclusion within oneself. This also implies that there is no limit to the depth of understanding that can be achieved on any particular subject. When someone says they "know" addition, that can mean a lot of things! It could mean they know that 1 + 1 = 2, it could mean that they are able to apply the tool of addition to a problem that did not demand it up front, and so on.

Musicians see this in a similar way. It's one thing to "know" the C-major scale, in the sense of being able to play the sequence of notes, and an entirely different thing to know all of the variations available in the scale, and to be able to apply those to make music in the moment.



That gap cannot be bridged through your conscious willing it so. And once you bridge the gap, you yourself don't even fully understand what you have done, not if you look at it too closely. Once you understand something at the level of being able to synthesize music on the fly from the C-major scale, you're not thinking about it consciously. It is beyond your attention.



Classical music training vs. jazz/church training. Jazz musicians have a fluency that many (at least modern) classical musicians lack.
